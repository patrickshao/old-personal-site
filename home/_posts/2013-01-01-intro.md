###About Me 

I am a third year computer science major at Pomona College. I have interned at IRIS.TV, where I was tasked to integrate IRIS.TV with the JWPlayer and create automated health checks for the backend systems. In addition, I love to code on my free time, attending all of the 5C Hackathons and have been awarded the best beginner's project during my first year alongside my team. Recently, I have developed the website for the startup that I have been working on known as cartpool which provides 1 hour deliveries to students within the Claremont Colleges in the evenings. I hope to continue to learn more about computer science and to use my skills to be able to make an impact on the world.
